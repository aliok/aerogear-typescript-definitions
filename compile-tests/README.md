Files in this folder are just for experimenting the tooling support and TS compiling.
Code here is not functional!
Whenever something is changed in the d.ts file, check if there is a compile error on these files.

Of course it is not the best way to check the entire thing, but unfortunately there is no easy way.
For example, one scenario would be adding a new optional parameter to a function. We cannot just add a lot of parameters to functions and expect them
 to break the compile.
